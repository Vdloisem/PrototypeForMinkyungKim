# Prototype for Automatic Paraphrase Evaluation

This notebook was created as a follow-up to a poster presentation by **Minkyung Kim** at the **CSEDU 2025** conference. It explores complementary techniques for paraphrase evaluation using lexical, semantic, and syntactic similarity features.

## 💡 What's inside?

The notebook includes:

- **Jaccard Similarity** (Lexical)
- **Sentence-BERT Cosine Similarity** (Semantic)
- **Tree Edit Distance using spaCy & ZSS** (Syntactic)
- Visual analyses of the scores
- Supervised classification models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`

It uses the **MRPC dataset** from the GLUE benchmark for experimentation.

## ▶️ Run on Google Colab

You can open the notebook in Google Colab using the following link:

👉 [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LAN2SHFxU2Txqc-3RwKYETgaODlcjqyN?usp=sharing)

Once opened:
1. Click `Runtime > Run all` to execute all cells.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting: Can't start the runtime?

If the Colab runtime doesn't start properly or if resources are limited:

- You can still **copy the code from each cell** in the notebook.
- Then, **paste it into your own new Colab notebook** via [site : colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).
- This will let you run everything independently.

## 📦 Required Python Libraries

The notebook installs all required libraries automatically via `pip`. These include:

- `datasets`
- `spacy`
- `sentence-transformers`
- `zss`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

It also downloads the spaCy models:
- `en_core_web_sm`
- `en_core_web_md`
